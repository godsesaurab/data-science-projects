        "\n",
        "* Trend: It represents the general direction in which a time series is moving over an extended period. It checks whether the values are increasing, decreasing or staying relatively constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Seasonality: Seasonality refers to repetitive patterns or cycles that occur at regular intervals within a time series corresponding to specific time units like days, weeks, months or seasons.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Moving average: It is used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Noise: It represents the irregular and unpredictable components in a time series that do not follow a pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Differencing: It is used to make the difference in values of a specified interval. By default itâ€™s 1 but we can specify different values for plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stationarity: A stationary time series is statistical properties such as mean, variance and autocorrelation remain constant over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Order: The order of differencing refers to the number of times the time series data needs to be differenced to achieve stationarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Autocorrelation: Autocorrelation is a statistical method used in time series analysis to quantify the degree of similarity between a time series and a lagged version of itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Resampling: Resampling is a technique in time series analysis that is used for changing the frequency of the data observations.\n",
