Trying out various Data Science Projects for learning 

## Projects :

### 1. House Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python
loaded and explored the house price dataset, handling missing values and preparing categorical features using One-Hot Encoding. We then trained and           evaluated three regression models (SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression) for house price prediction, finding that the Random Forest model                performed best based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error.
